# Object-Oriented Programming – Java Assignments

📘 This repository contains the programming assignments developed for the subject **Object-Oriented Programming** at **TecnoCampus Mataró (UPF)**.

## 🧠 Overview

These assignments aim to deepen understanding of programming using **Java**, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Throughout the practices, students progressively apply:

- Classes, objects, attributes and methods
- Encapsulation, abstraction, and modular design
- Use of inheritance and composition
- Control structures, arrays, and file handling
- Proper project structure and code reusability

## 📁 Contents

### ✅ Practice 1: Basics of Java and Control Structures
- Use of variables, loops, and conditionals
- Standard input/output
- First contact with Java syntax and structure

### ✅ Practice 2: Methods and Data Structures
- Modularization using functions
- Introduction to arrays
- Logical program decomposition

### ✅ Practice 3: Introduction to OOP
